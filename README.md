RailVista – Revolutionizing Rail Travel in India
Overview
RailVista is a full-stack web application designed to improve the overall train travel experience by offering real-time assistance, smart navigation, and passenger-friendly features. Built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for database management, the platform ensures that train journeys are not only convenient but also safe, enjoyable, and interactive.

The website primarily caters to passengers traveling across Indian Railways, helping them with scenic view alerts, lost and found assistance, real-time crowd monitoring, and emergency support.

Key Features and How They Work
1️⃣ Scenic View Notifications – Enjoy the Journey with Real-time Alerts
One of the standout features of RailVista is its real-time scenic view notification system.

As the train moves, the website tracks the passenger's location and detects if they are approaching notable scenic spots.
Once they enter a 2 km radius of a marked scenic location, a notification is triggered, allowing passengers to look outside and enjoy the view.
This feature is especially useful for tourists and travel enthusiasts, helping them discover beautiful landscapes, rivers, mountains, and heritage sites.
🚀 How it enhances travel:
Passengers can enjoy a more immersive travel experience by not missing out on scenic locations along their route, making their journey more memorable.

2️⃣ Interactive Lost and Found System – Never Lose Your Belongings Again
Losing items while traveling is common, but RailVista’s interactive lost and found system makes recovery easier:

Passengers can report lost items by providing details such as train number, date, item description, and contact information.
Others who find lost items can report them as found, helping connect travelers to their misplaced belongings.
Items that have been found and verified are displayed in a separate "Founded Items" section, making it easy for passengers to reclaim their belongings.
The Admin Panel allows administrators to manage lost and found reports, ensuring that the system remains organized and efficient.
🚀 How it enhances travel:
This feature reduces anxiety for passengers by providing an efficient way to recover lost belongings without having to go through lengthy railway procedures.

3️⃣ Crowd Status Monitoring – Avoid Overcrowded Coaches
Traveling in unreserved train coaches can be chaotic due to unpredictable crowd levels. RailVista helps passengers make better travel decisions by providing:

Real-time crowd monitoring, where passengers can check how full an unreserved coach is before boarding.
The data is gathered using crowd-sourced reports, where travelers update the coach status through the website.
The system displays whether a coach is empty, moderate, or overcrowded, allowing passengers to choose a comfortable seating option.
🚀 How it enhances travel:
Passengers can plan their journey better, avoid overcrowded coaches, and choose alternative routes or compartments for a stress-free journey.

4️⃣ Instant Emergency Help – Quick SOS Alerts via Twitter
Safety is a major concern for train travelers, especially during long journeys. RailVista includes an instant help feature that allows passengers to:

Send emergency alerts via Twitter in under 5 seconds.
The system auto-generates a tweet containing the passenger’s train details, location, and emergency request, ensuring that authorities and fellow travelers are alerted instantly.
This feature is designed for quick response in distress situations, such as theft, harassment, or medical emergencies.
🚀 How it enhances travel:
Passengers can reach out for help faster, increasing the chances of getting timely assistance in emergencies.

5️⃣ Community & Tourism Promotion – Connecting Travelers
RailVista goes beyond just being a utility website—it also builds a community of train travelers:

Passengers can share their experiences, recommend scenic routes, and post travel tips.
The community section helps in promoting local tourism by highlighting lesser-known travel spots that passengers might otherwise miss.
🚀 How it enhances travel:
RailVista encourages interaction among travelers, helps discover hidden gems in India, and promotes tourism by sharing real passenger experiences.
